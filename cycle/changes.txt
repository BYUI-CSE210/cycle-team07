ATTENION: Several changes were applicable generally across multiple files so I lumped them into "General Changes"

General Changes:
    1. Added the comment """Global Imports""" at the top of every file that has global imports
    2. Fixed many of the class and method comments across several files
    3. Deleted unnecessary empty lines and fixed various grammar errors across several files
    4. Changed every occurrence of the word "Snake" to "Cycle" across every applicable file to reflect the correct game title

Specific Changes:
    __main__.py:
        1. deleted the unnecessary imports for Color and Point

    cycle.py:
        1. fixed the class and method comments
        2. fixed the "leave_trail" method to slowly lengthen the trail at a 1:5 (increment:loop) ratio. The previous method would lengthen by (1) w/ every loop but mine slows it down which I found to be a better balance

    handle_collisions_action.py:
        1. Added code to check when a cycle runs into its own trail(lines 68-86)
        2. Added code to save a message declaring the winner & the cause of the Game Over
        3. Added code to display the winner & display the Game Over cause
    
    Deleted the following unnecessary extra files:
        1. snake2.py
        2. control_actors2.py
        3. draw_actors_action2.py
        4. handle_collissions2.py
